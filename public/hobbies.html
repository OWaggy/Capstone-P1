<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>I take great pride in having hobbies and i make sure they vary. I love to play golf,
    I try to play at least once a week in the winter and three times a week in the summer.
    I love sports in general, I watch as much football as I can but also will watch golf, darts,
    rugby and cricket. Like I said previously my hobbies vary so you may be surprised that another
    hobby of mine is gardening. I have my own allotment, I grow all types of vegetables, fruits and herbs.

    Aside from those hobbies I also socialise with my friends. Whether that's going to sporting events,
    meeting them in the cities they now live or simply just going to the pub.
